# Huzaifa Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio. This project is a showcase of my work as a web developer, built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The portfolio features a responsive design with interactive elements—such as a hamburger menu—and utilizes the Remix Icons library for enhanced visual appeal.

## About Me

I am **Huzaifa**, a dedicated web developer focused on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. This portfolio reflects my current skill set and serves as a foundation for my future work as I explore advanced frameworks and backend technologies.

## Portfolio Highlights

- **Zentry Clone**  
  A responsive, multipage website designed to replicate the look and feel of the original Zentry platform. This project helped me refine my front-end skills and implement modern UI/UX practices.

- **Product Landing Page for Headphones**  
  A custom landing page inspired by the Beats Solo3 Wireless Ear Headphones product page on Amazon. The design emphasizes high conversion rates, responsive layout, and engaging visuals.
